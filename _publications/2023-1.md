Lane detection plays a pivotal role in the field of autonomous vehicles and advanced driving assistant systems (ADAS). Despite advances from image processing to deep learning-based models, algorithm performance is highly dependent on training data matching the local challenges such as extreme lighting conditions, partially visible lane markings, and sparse lane markings like Botts' dots. To address this, we present an end-to-end lane detection and classification system based on deep learning methodologies. In our study, we introduce a unique dataset meticulously curated to encompass scenarios that pose significant challenges for state-of-the-art (SOTA) lane localization models. Moreover, we propose a CNN-based classification branch, seamlessly integrated with the detector, facilitating the identification of distinct lane types. This architecture enables informed lane-changing decisions and em-powers â€¦
